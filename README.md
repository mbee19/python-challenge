Module 3 Challenge for Morgan Bee

In this challenge, I worked with my classmate Kiley Karecki on both PyBank and PyPoll. We worked together to define variables and start each challenge, and wrap our heads around what each was asking of us. 

In both PyBank and PyPoll, I used the Xpert Learning Assistant to help find how to perform functions in Python, including round() and help with forming and printing dictionaries, as well as the enumerate() when printing through lists. 

Specifically for PyPoll, Iused this YouTube video to help me understand dictionaries: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daefaLgNkw0. I used this Stack Overflow page to help me add to the value in key/value pairs in dictionaries: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9623836/adding-a-constant-integer-to-a-value-in-a-python-dictionary. 

For PyBank, a basic Google search showed me the abs() function, as well as skipping to the next line in a text file using "\n". 

Finally, I reviewed and used snippets of code from the class activities this week to help me read and write files from Python.
